This is relevant to the patient's condition as he has a T12 chance fracture and power in bilateral lower limbs is 2 out of 5, indicating possible spinal cord injury. (2/2)\n3. The retrieved context is not concise and contains a lot of irrelevant information. It discusses various other imaging techniques and their appropriateness in different scenarios, which is not relevant to the patient's condition or the query. It also repeats information about the inferiority of CT scans compared to MRI in identifying soft-tissue pathologies. (0.5/2)\n\n[RESULT] 4.5/6", "1. The retrieved context matches the description of the patient inside the query. The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of various conditions, including osteoarthritis of bilateral knees post bilateral total knee replacement, and is now presenting with low back pain for 6 days. The context discusses the appropriateness of MRI scans for patients with low back pain, which is relevant to the patient's current condition. (2/2)\n2. The retrieved context can be used to answer whether it is appropriate to order MRI scans for the particular patient. It provides detailed information about when MRI scans are recommended for patients with low back pain, including those with subacute or chronic low back pain who have failed 6 weeks of conservative therapy and are believed to be candidates for surgery or intervention. However, it does not provide a definitive answer for this specific patient as she has only had low back pain for 6 days and it is not clear if she has failed conservative therapy. (1.5/2)\n3. The retrieved context is not very concise. It provides a lot of information about the general guidelines for ordering MRI scans for patients with low back pain, but much of this information is not directly relevant to the patient's specific situation. There is also some repeated information about the lack of benefit of early imaging in patients with acute low back pain. (1/2)\n\n[RESULT] 4.5/6", "1. The retrieved context matches the description of the patient inside the query. The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, reduced pinprick sensation, and difficulty controlling continence are all discussed in the context. The context also mentions the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and the need for an MRI scan to assess for myelopathy. Therefore, the context is relevant to the patient's profile. (2/2)\n2. The retrieved context can be used to answer whether it is appropriate to order MRI scans for the particular patient. The context discusses the use of MRI scans in evaluating patients with symptoms similar to those of the patient, such as numbness and tingling in the limbs, reduced sensation, and difficulty controlling continence. It also discusses the use of MRI scans in assessing for myelopathy, which is the reason the scan was ordered for the patient. Therefore, the context provides sufficient information to determine the appropriateness of the ordered scan. (2/2)\n3. The retrieved context is not very concise. There is a lot of irrelevant information about other conditions and treatments that are not relevant to the patient's condition. There is also some repeated information about the use of MRI scans in evaluating patients with similar symptoms. However, the relevant information is detailed and useful. (1/2)\n\n[RESULT] 5/6."]}}
